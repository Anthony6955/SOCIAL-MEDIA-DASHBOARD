### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **social media performance metrics** across major platforms - Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter (X), and YouTube.  

It was built to provide clear insights into **user growth, engagement, time spent, and demographic distribution** (urban vs rural) through an interactive Excel dashboard.  
The dashboard helps businesses, marketers, and analysts quickly understand:
- Which platforms are growing the fastest,
- Where users spend the most time,
- Which platform drives the highest engagement,
- How audiences differ between **urban and rural** areas.
###  Objectives
- Analyze user growth trends across social media platforms.  
- Compare total time spent by users on each platform.
- Identify the platform with the highest engagement rate.
- Visualize urban vs rural audience distribution.  
- Build a professional Excel dashboard that presents all metrics in one place.
##  Process / Methodology

### 1 Data Collection
A custom dataset was created containing:
- Platform names  
- Active users  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate (%)  
- Average daily time spent (minutes)  
- Engagement rate (%)  
- Urban and rural user distribution (%)
- ### 2 Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Verified and standardized data formats (percentages, minutes, etc.).  
- Removed inconsistencies and ensured proper column labeling.  
- Organized the dataset into an Excel table for easy analysis.
### 3 Data Analysis
Used **Pivot Tables** to summarize key insights such as:
- Growth by Platform  
- Total Time Spent by Platform  
- Engagement Rate per Platform  
- Urban vs Rural User Split  
Additional formulas were applied to calculate totals and averages for better insights.
### 4 Data Visualization
Created **Pivot Charts** and visual elements including:
-  *Growth by Platform* (Column Chart)  
-  *Total Time Spent by Platform* (Bar Chart)  
-  *Platform with Highest Engagement* (Line Chart)  
-  *Urban vs Rural Distribution* (Clustered Bar Chart)  
Each chart was formatted with clear labels, legends, and a consistent color palette.
### 5 Dashboard Design
- Combined all charts into a single, interactive **Dashboard sheet**.  
- Added Slicers and Filters for dynamic navigation.  
- Included summary cards highlighting key metrics:
- Growth by Platform: TikTok (57%)  
- Total Time Spent: 349 minutes  
- Highest Engagement: WhatsApp (7.1%)
- Urban vs Rural Split: Urban (76.57%) | Rural (23.43%)  
- Enhanced layout and formatting to create a professional, business-ready dashboard.
